## A day in the life of a fibromyalgia patient

Have you ever heard of fibromyalgia?

If you haven‚Äôt, it is a terrible condition that causes people pain and
tenderness throughout the body, as well as fatigue and trouble sleeping.

Scientists don‚Äôt fully understand the cause and there is no official cure for
it yet.

A while back, TheFibroClinic published an article that went into detail about
what it feels like to live with fibromyalgia.

#### Here are some snippets from that article :

‚ÄúMemory loss is embarrassing to say the least.‚Äù

‚ÄúI also have ongoing very bad pain in my back and hips which is brought on by
standing mostly at the kitchen sink after a few seconds, walking or any
movement in fact.‚Äù

‚Äú ..sleep has been a very difficult issue and until recently due to medication
I‚Äôve only been able to sleep on average about 4 hours a night, now I sleep a
little longer.‚Äù

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been able to cope with the computer for longer than 20 minutes at
the most without feeling stressed or having a brain fog.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have awful indigestion although I eat little and very slowly and I
frequently feel sick‚Ä¶ I have gradually lost my enjoyment of food.‚Äù

‚ÄúI feel as if I have a urine infection most of the time which again interrupts
the night as I get up between 5 to 7 times a night and can‚Äôt go out without
stopping frequently.‚Äù

‚ÄúI experience extreme itching all over my body at times and this can for me
exceed the pain as it is so tormenting.‚Äù

Like I said earlier, it is a terrible condition and scientists are still
trying to understand this.

While there is no official cure for fibromyalgia, I strongly believe
BIOSUPERFOOD may help improve the pain, lack of sleep and overall health of
anybody struggling with this.

A few of my customers with this condition have used BIOSUPERFOOD (BSF) and
have reported massive improvements.

#### For instance, Bruce in Denver :

‚ÄúI have fibromyalgia and I‚Äôve been taking BSF for two weeks.

I just spent hours with a friend shopping, walking and goofing around with no
fatigue and no burning muscles.

I could not even go to the store before.

I was taking 12 to 14 Vanquish a day for constant burn and daily headaches. I
take nothing but BSF now and have just a little pain left in my neck and no
headaches.

I am sleeping every night, and have noticed dreaming again, and remembering my
dreams when I wake up.

The depression is gone, I have great concentration. I don‚Äôt get distracted all
the time any more. And I can handle stress. I used to be constantly on edge
and irritable.

My skin has cleared up, I used to have rashes and outbreaks but now even my
dry skin is gone.‚Äù

Whether you are struggling with mild pain, lack of sleep, constant fatigue or
maybe even more advanced conditions like fibromyalgia, BIOSUPERFOOD can
support your recovery by nourishing your body and brain cells adequately
causing them to perform their functions better.

## Why I don&#8217;t advice HRT

A long time ago, I thought menopause was a simple stage in women‚Äôs natural
life cycle.

Now after helping several women going through menopause, I understand how
disrupting menopausal symptoms truly are and how it‚Äôs getting worse in
America.

The truth is, menopause may be a natural stage, but it certainly isn‚Äôt simple
or easy.

And to relieve the symptoms, many medical practitioners recommend Hormone
Replacement Therapy (HRT).

This is a procedure used to supplement the body with hormones (such as
estrogen and testosterone) that may be lacking due to menopause.

#### However, there is a big problem :

#### Cancer.

Hormone Replacement Therapy is now associated with an increased risk of
coronary heart disease, stroke, pulmonary embolism, uterine cancer and
invasive breast cancer.

#### And that is exactly why I don‚Äôt recommend it.

Some say the risk of cancer is quite low if you are younger than 50 years and
the risk of cancer decreases once you stop the procedure‚Ä¶

But it just doesn‚Äôt make sense to use a solution that has side effects which
are potentially worse than the problem.

#### What do I recommend instead?

I recommend using an effective natural product which can bring you relief but
contains no chemically generated compounds, fillers or artificial additives
and (most importantly) has NO negative side effects.

#### Which brings me to BIOSUPERFOOD.

I have many customers who use BIOSUPERFOOD to support their health while going
through menopause and have reported less pain, less anxiety, better mood, skin
improvements, etc.

For instance, here‚Äôs how Kathleen, used BIOSUPERFOOD to support herself during
menopause:

‚ÄúThe following are the improvements I have experienced with the BIOSUPERFOOD
F3K formula.

The ability to reason has significantly improved, I can think much more
clearly and handle stressful situations much better than before. I am more
‚Äúresilient‚Äù emotionally.

My energy level has improved and I am able to stay up later in the evening
while still being mentally alert. I feel I have a calmer nervous system with a
better, more relaxed attitude. I used to feel uptight, irritable, impatient
and tense ‚Äì remarkably these symptoms have for the most part gone away.

My hair has improved by 50%, a full healthy texture not seen since pre-
menopause (I LOVE THIS) also my skin has improved 30%, a younger looking glow
‚Ä¶ I still use some of my expensive skin care products, but this improvement is
not due to these products that I was using prior to the BSF, a woman knows
this!

As you know I am 48 years old and have been suffering from menopausal symptoms
for a while now, at the advice of my well intentioned girlfriends I requested
( Hormone Replacement Therapy) from my Doctor.

Now, being aware of the dangers of taking HRT, I had been looking for a way to
gradually get off of them.

For the first 2 months of taking BIOSUPERFOOD Fk3 at 8-9 capsules a day, I
started decreasing my HRT to every other day with no noticeable problems
whatsoever.

At the beginning of the 3rd month I decreased to taking the HRT every 3rd day,
for the first 7 to 10 days it was a little rough going however, after that
once again I am doing very well with this schedule.

These are amazing results using a product for only 3 months; I can hardly wait
to see what future benefits lay ahead.

Also, Mom has her own great results to share with you like increased energy
level and remembering things better than before ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ We both don‚Äôt ever want to
run out of our BSF.

**Much gratitude‚Äù**

## How menopause can change you overnight

Since I wrote about menopause yesterday, I wanted to share just how much
change menopause can bring to a person‚Äôs life ‚Ä¶ seemingly overnight.

For instance, here‚Äôs a question I recently came access regarding this:

_‚ÄúGood afternoon ladies_

_I am struggling to believe that menopause (or perimenopause in my case) can
cause so many symptoms._

_I‚Äôve read about 5 different books on the subject and I know that all of my
symptoms can be related to perimenopause, but seriously I have virtually every
symptom in the book üôÅ_

#### _The worst part for me is the constant feeling of anxiety/panic._

_I feel wretched every day and can‚Äôt get myself out of it._

_I‚Äôm so tense that a slight noise literally has me jumping out of my skin and
I feel like a tightly wound spring. Constantly feel like crying :'(._

_As a result, my head and neck are so tight that I keep having spasms, jaw
pain, ear blocked/fullness._

#### _I honestly feel like I can‚Äôt carry on like this for much longer._

_I‚Äôm on day 2 of trying estrogel again and I‚Äôm praying it helps._

_My doctor has said that I can try antidepressants but I don‚Äôt like taking
medication._

_Has anyone felt like this and have any advice? It would be greatly
appreciated._

_Thank you so much x‚Äù_

Then here‚Äôs a snippet from a response given to the lady above:

_‚ÄúMine came out of the blue, almost ALL the symptoms switched on over a period
of 2 weeks, the worst being anxiety and panic attacks._

_I changed overnight‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt know myself, or did my family._

_I had no idea, I honestly thought I had something serious._

_After countless trips to the GP and A &E with symptoms and all tests showing
fine, I was at a loss. _

_Never had a panic attack before, I had no idea of the physical symptoms of
panic/anxiety._

_I was offered antidepressants by my GP but was too scared to take them due to
the side effects of being more anxious before getting better ‚Äì my anxiety
became health anxiety and it was gripping me._

_I did have beta blockers which did help, but I wanted to get to the bottom of
it, this came from nowhere. Nobody mentioned menopause!_

_From my own research, believing the doctors had missed something I kept
stumbling on menopause‚Äù_

Most people don‚Äôt fully grasp the extent to which hormones affect mood,
behavior, anxiety, depression, etc ‚Ä¶

But most women who had a rough transition into menopause can tell you it is
not fun.

#### Fortunately, it doesn‚Äôt have to be so painful.

I‚Äôve had several customers use BIOSUPERFOOD that have seen a significant
reduction of anxiety, hot flashes, depression, etc that come with menopause.

It contains 4 bioavailable, complete and balanced microalgae that contain
thousands of nutrients that easily reach and nourish the cells of certain
areas of the brain that are more difficult to reach than others.

This nourishment can lead to better metabolism regulation and hormone
production in the body which may help menopausal symptoms.

**PS : I shared this testimonial yesterday, but just in case you didn‚Äôt see
it, here‚Äôs it again :**

‚ÄúThe following are the improvements I have experienced with the
**BIOSUPERFOOD** F3K formula.

The ability to reason has significantly improved, I can think much more
clearly and handle stressful situations much better than before. I am more

## Can you unlock hidden cellular energy at will?

This testimonial from a customer, Craig shows that it just might be possible :

‚ÄùI benefited tremendously right away from your product, when I had a film crew
coming Monday and my speech and energy on Friday had been terrible.

I had a good feeling from the BIOSUPERFOOD, and I decided to attempt two
capsules three times daily to see if it could save the day of 12 hours of
filming because the documentary could change my life.

I sensed remarkable energy by the end of the night and felt the best I had in
many months. I continued to do the same thing the next two days, and my energy
and speaking were no doubt at a level that was due to BIOSUPERFOOD.

I felt the happiest in years.

I am not attributing all the happiness, but the BIOSUPERFOOD helped make it
physically possible. My breathing is better and so is my mood.

My mother (cancer survivor) takes the same amount as me, and we both had
amazing changes in the reduction of pain in our body when we began taking
BIOSUPERFOOD, and that has continued.

#### I tell people if they want to take fewer supplements, they should take
BIOSUPERFOOD.

Peace and gratitude. ‚Äù ‚Äì Craig Oster, PhD, a 21.5-year survivor of ALS (Lou
Gehrig‚Äôs disease), and Co-founder/Scientist/Advocate at THE HEALERS campaign

Whether you are a busy professional who would love more energy as you go into
a stressful week ‚Ä¶ or maybe you‚Äôre an athlete that would love faster recovery
‚Ä¶ or maybe you just want to support your body‚Äôs immune system in fighting
against diseases, protection from viruses, or vaccinations, BIOSUPERFOOD may
be able to help you.

BIOSUPERFOOD can work for such a wide variety of usages/cases because it is
not a drug designed to ‚Äúcure‚Äù or ‚Äútreat‚Äù any particular symptom.

It is a blend of 4 balanced, complete and bioavailable wholefood microalgae
that provide adequate nutrition and energy to the cells of the body and brain
enabling them to protect, build, repair, heal, grow and multiply.

Which then leads to longer and healthier cell life, resulting in healthier
tissues, healthier organs and ultimately a healthier body.

After all, it is not medicine that heals, but our cells. Our cells are the
true medicine ‚Äì over 100 trillion cells, regenerating billions more every
single day.

We just need to supply the cells with the right fuel.

As I like to say: ‚ÄúLet thy food be thy fuel and thy cells be thy medicine.‚Äù

And BIOSUPERFOOD is the best ‚Äúcell fuel‚Äù I have found.

It is backed by 20+ years of intensive research, hundreds of staff and over 1
million animals tested, across 20 species.

## The big sunscreen hoax

Napoleon Bonaparte (the famous war general) once said :

‚ÄúDoctors will have more lives to answer for in the next world than even we
generals‚Äù

Of course, he was probably joking but there is an element of truth in that
statement.

There are just so many things we do medically that have the potential of
harming us (even though it is not apparent now).

#### For example : Sunscreen.

We have all been told that exposure to sunlight can cause sunburn and skin
cancer and we need to use sunscreen to prevent this risk.

But the truth is a lot more complicated than that.

I am out in the sun a lot.

I am a long-distance runner, an avid golfer and I also care for my vegetable
garden which means I am usually in the sun for several hours every day.

I have fair white skin and for the past 17 years of my life I have not used
sunscreen and I NEVER get sunburned.

So why then are we sold this lie that we MUST use sunscreen to prevent
sunburn?

Sunscreen can obviously be used to repel some of the sun‚Äôs UV rays, but there
are a couple of problems with it:

**#1** ‚Äì According to the Cancer Council, for sunscreen to effectively work,
you must apply 1 full teaspoon (not the pea size most people apply) EVERY 2
hours. Most people either don‚Äôt have the time or are just unwilling to re-
apply this frequently.

**#2** ‚Äì Studies have shown that the chemicals used in sunscreens are
penetrating our skin and going to the cells. Some of these chemicals have been
shown to be toxic to the cells while the long-term effects of others are
relatively unknown but it is still something to think about.

#### What then do I advise?

Well, a bit of common sense.

Don‚Äôt stay hours on the beach without proper covering. Direct exposure to
sunlight for extended periods is a sure way to get sunburned.

Stay under proper shading, wear clothes that cover your body, wear a hat, etc

But you don‚Äôt need to rub a bunch of chemicals on your body if you don‚Äôt want
to.

In other news, many of my customers have reported having younger, smoother
skin after using BIOSUPERFOOD.

#### For example, here is what Ron has to say :

‚ÄúBy the way I just ordered another bottle of BIOSUPERFOOD F3k. Hard to believe
how good that stuff is.

I noticed recently that looking in the mirror my skin in my face seems to look
much younger but I thought that was just a figment of my imagination until a
few days ago, a friend of mine asked me what happened to my face, why does it
look different, like much younger.

WOW!! By the way I am not a spring chicken at 73 years old and now going on 44
. I also have more energy than I used to have.

**Thanks a million.‚Äù**

The principal reason(s) for the increased UV protection with BIOSUPERFOOD, is
the presence of many protective pigments in the algae blend, and also that
adding BSF to your daily regimen, supports the body‚Äôs increased anti-
inflammatory and anti-oxidative cellular power from deep into organs all the
way to the skin layers.

## A soda a day keeps good health away

We have a pandemic of fast food in the West.

More and more fast-food restaurants are being built everywhere and it is
contributing massively to the health problems we face.

There was an interesting study done in France where rats were given a choice
between highly sweetened water and intravenous cocaine.

Surprisingly the rats preferred the highly sweetened water.

The scientists ran the same tests on rats that were already experienced
cocaine ‚Äúusers‚Äù (i.e. they had learned to self-administer cocaine) and they
still opted for sweetened water over the drug.

#### Which is just mind-blowing to think about.

The scientists were reluctant to generalize these results to humans but there
is definitely a strong indication that sugars can be extremely addictive
(maybe even as addictive as cocaine).

And yet the consumption of sodas and junk food keeps rising every year.

That is why more than half of the population in the US is obese.

And unfortunately, obesity is like the ‚Äúmaster illness‚Äù.

It just makes it easier to get every other illness ‚Äì everything from high
blood pressure to diabetes and even depression.

It is now considered a major causality in the growing epidemic of Alzheimer‚Äôs.

In fact, I would argue that if we cut out soda and fast food by 90%, we would
by far live a healthier, more energetic and more happy life.

Apart from reducing Soda and fast food, another essential way to support your
health is by supplying your body with the right nutrients.

#### And BIOSUPERFOOD can help you do just that.

BIOSUPERFOOD is one of the most complete foods on earth, containing over
15,000 nutrients, including vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and K, all known minerals
and trace elements and all known amino acids.

The best part is that we have REAL research to back it up.

Dr Michael Kiriac and hundreds of clinicians and farm aids spent more than 15
years investigating and researching the ‚Äúperfect algae blend‚Äù in which all the
nutrients worked hand in hand to aid absorption and cell health.

The formula blends have been clinically proven and have been used in animal
and human applications for over 40 years.

They have also received Health Canada Certification and Natural Product
Numbers, implying that each lot of the final products (not just randomly
selected) is tested according to Health Canada requirements (the U.S.
equivalent to the F.D.A).

Safe to say ‚Ä¶ It is tried and tested.

If you are looking for optimum health in both your organs and your brain,
check out BIOSUPERFOOD here:

time users).

Lastly, a word from a happy user, **Linda Epstein :**

‚ÄúI was taking over 60 different supplements a day.

My husband was taking 16.

**BIOSUPERFOOD** replaced them all. Now, I am 68 years old and do not take any
medication.

My doctor says I have the blood pressure and the arteries of a 40-year-old‚Äù ‚Äì

## 4 horrid health rules I happily break

In the health industry, there are certain ‚Äúrules‚Äù about what is right and
wrong to do.

Many of these have been perpetuated for over 40 years, while some are more
recent with the rise of internet ‚Äúhealth experts‚Äù

In my opinion, most of those rules should be thrown out the window and paid no
attention to absolutely.

In that spirit, here are 4 ‚Äúhealth rules‚Äù I discard:

#### **#1 ‚Äì Using supplements :**

If you‚Äôve been following me for a while, you know I don‚Äôt use supplements. I
haven‚Äôt used them for the past 23 years of my life and I have been happy and
healthy ever since.

Supplementation has been touted as the holy grail of health for several
decades, but in reality, it is not as effective as simply eating proper whole
foods.

Even worse, many supplements come in isolation meaning they lack the necessary
nutrients (co-factors) the body needs to assimilate them.

Most nutrients don‚Äôt work in isolation ‚Äì they are not designed that way in
nature and our body cells don‚Äôt accept them that way.

#### **#2 ‚Äì Dieting :**

Diets have been a big part of our Western culture for many years now.

And honestly, I have experimented with it in the past. ‚Äì I was vegetarian at
times and even fruitarian for a while and, later on, vegan.

But after several years of trying that and seeing people get hooked on various
diet/health systems, I pretty much discard all of them today.

Not because they don‚Äôt offer individual benefits.

A lot of these approaches (ayurveda, veganism, raw/paleolithic, etc ) can
bring insight, knowledge, and benefit ‚Ä¶ but strictly relying on ANY system of
eating is a recipe for failure.

Reliance often results in fundamentalism, isolation, and a big helping of
guilt if you fail!

It is more important to enjoy food freedom.

Eat wisely, make healthy choices, but eat freely.

Then listen to your body, notice any changes/symptoms that occur and adapt
your eating strategy accordingly.

#### **#3 ‚Äì Sunlight & sunscreen :**

I wrote about this in a recent email and I will repeat it again ‚Äì sunlight is
not our enemy.

Yes, you want to avoid overexposure to the sun (common sense is mostly all you
need as a guide) but there should be no fear of ‚Äúgetting‚Äù skin cancer by
simply bathing in sunlight.

The sun is the source of all life on earth.

The sun is good for us.

It soothes our nerves, boosts our moods, and increases the production of much
more than vitamin D, for example; endorphins, serotonin, and melatonin in our
brain which leaves us feeling way better.

Adequate sunlight does the body much good and it is a shame that the ‚Äúhealth‚Äù
industry is instilling the fear of sunlight into so many today.

#### **#4 ‚Äì Intermittent fasting :**

For the longest time, I have been a big fan of fasting ‚Äì I used to practice
and write about it a lot in my previous newsletters.

My longest fast lasted six months on Indian chapati, yogi tea, and a 5-mile
run every day.

I have also experimented with various short-length water fasts in the past and
I have reaped their cleansing and detoxification benefits.

But today fasting has become a fad.

Experts are making it more complicated than it needs to be, giving it fancy
names with specific time frames.

When it is simply not eating, or eating less.

Everybody knows how to eat less.

You don‚Äôt need a guide, or a coach to teach you how to fast. Simply remove 1
or 2 meals from your daily intake and you are automatically fasting.

I believe fasting (eating less) is a good health practice, I just don‚Äôt like
the fad it is becoming.

To round this up, I am not saying you have to break the rules I break or
follow the rules I follow (especially if your current method is working for
you).

We are all different humans and will react differently to different diets or
fast.

I am just challenging you to see a little more than the internet tells you, to
question the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù out there, and to make health decisions knowing why you
are making such decisions.

Speaking of health decisions, a good health decision you can make is to
include BIOSUPERFOOD in your daily regimen.

But you don‚Äôt have to trust my word on that.

Simply look at the research and the results.

It is backed by 20+ years of intensive research, hundreds of staff, and over 1
million animals tested, across 20 species.

For the past 10 years, I have had several customers tell me BIOSUPERFOOD was
essential in helping them recover from several conditions ‚Äì everything from
chronic fatigue to diabetes, menopausal symptoms, glaucoma, period pain and so
much more.

It is all detailed in the research.

## The dark secret behind the food industry

A few days ago, I wrote about how addictive sodas and fast food can be‚Ä¶

Recently, I came across a video that showed that it‚Äôs not just fast food

It‚Äôs also processed/packaged food in general (I.e. almost 90% of foods on our
store shelves)

In that video, Calley Means (the founder of TrueMed) pointed out how the
processed food industry was created by the cigarette industry.

It turns out that in the 1980s, cigarette companies were getting some backlash
due to the health problems caused by cigarettes.

So the two largest cigarette companies (RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris) used
their cash piles to buy food companies.

They then shifted their thousands of scientists who were experts at making
cigarettes addictive to the food department.

They started experimenting with foods, adding several flavoring,
preservatives, salting, etc

All of which gave people a spike in dopamine when they eat, which makes the
food more addicting (I.e. it leaves you craving for more).

#### And that was the rise of ultra-processed food.

So It‚Äôs no surprise that today we have a lot of people who can‚Äôt seem to do
away with fast food/processed foods (even when they know they should).

That‚Äôs exactly how the food was designed to do.

It‚Äôs even sadder when you realize that two-thirds of most children‚Äôs meals is
now ultra-processed food (according to a 2018 study).

These are children in their formative years who should be getting the most
nutritional foods available for proper cognitive and physical development but
are now primarily eating (and getting addicted to) food developed by the
cigarette industry.

That‚Äôs the bad news.

The good news is that it‚Äôs not too hard to take control of your health and
nutrition.

You just need some intentionality.

One simple step is to start from your refrigerator and kitchen.

Replace ultra-processed foods and drinks like hot dogs, soda, cookies, chips
etc with fresh, whole food alternatives like nuts, fruits, carrots, etc and
you are already on your way to better nutrition.

In a few months and years, your body will thank you.

There is another extremely effective way to support your health and nutrition
that I have been using and recommending to my clients for the last 24 years.

And that is BIOSUPERFOOD.

I believe it to be the most efficient and nutrient-dense food to add to your
diet

It contains  _ALL_ the ‚Äúbuilding blocks‚Äù (i.e. amino acids) required for the
brain to manufacture neurotransmitters and it also consists of thousands of
nutrients that nourish the brain and the body cells.

Lastly, here‚Äôs what a happy customer Robert says about **BIOSUPERFOOD :**

_‚ÄúThis BIOSUPERFOOD F3k formula is the BEST health food I have EVER purchased.
It is super for fighting my chronic pain and fatigue. I sincerely wish I had
started F3k when at age 20 ‚Äì I am currently age 71. After 53 years of studying
the health food industry, my advice ‚Äòdon‚Äôt chase other products, just order
F3k‚Äô._

Start saving your health at age 20.

**Thank you ‚Äì Robert**

**PS : I notice a ‚Äòcumulative‚Äô effect of the F3k use as mental clarity, less
physical pain, and the senses‚Äìhearing, sight, etc., have ‚Äòbreakthrough‚Äô times
where I notice marked improvement.‚Äù**

## Pain so bad, it feels like my insides are on fire

If you‚Äôre a woman, you understand just how bad period pain can be.

While it is generally not fun, some people just have it worse.

#### For instance, here‚Äôs a story I recently saw (slightly edited for clarity)
:

‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm a female in my early 20s and I think I‚Äôve got endometriosis or
something.

Anyway, the pain I get on my period is so severe I almost faint, vomit
repeatedly, and physically cannot walk.

I literally crawl to the bathroom or sometimes can manage to get there bent
down, urination is excruciating and I get intense sharp pain in a localized
area in my lower right

abdomen (I genuinely cannot imagine pain worse than this).

I go extremely pale, shake a lot, and sweat.‚Äù

She then continued by saying she has been using a pill to help with the pain
but it seems she is getting a side effect of ‚Äúdaily nausea, sometimes vomiting
and loss of appetite‚Äù

#### In a related story, I saw this comment :

‚ÄúI‚Äôd really like to know everyone‚Äôs tips on what they do to help relieve
period pains! It‚Äôs not crazy bad, but like damn it feels like my insides are
on fire??‚Äù

While these may be extreme cases, you (or someone you know) are probably
battling with some level of painful periods right now.

And if you‚Äôre like most women, you have probably tried all the tricks in the
book (hot water bottle, pain relief, exercise, etc).

#### One more thing you can try is BIOSUPERFOOD.

It is not a ‚Äúpain-relief‚Äù medication, but I have heard from enough customers
that they noticed a decrease in pain while on BIOSUPERFOOD.

#### For instance :

Here‚Äôs a testimonial I got from one of my clients in Australia:

‚ÄúIn addition to taking F3k on a regular basis for general health, I up the F3k
taken during times of period pain to 6-8 per day which greatly decreases the
pain and allows me to function more normally in daily life rather than curled
up in bed for several days.

BIOSUPERFOOD is the only natural supplement other than heat that has ever had
any positive effect when I have period pain.

As such I have highly recommended this product on numerous occasions both to
family and friends.‚Äù

If you battle with extreme pain (during periods or otherwise) or if you know
someone that does, BIOSUPERFOOD may be able to help them.

**PS : If your period pain is really extreme, it will be helpful to see a
medical doctor, just to clarify there are no bigger problems.**

## Our big advantage over supplement brands

One of the big advantages of BIOSUPERFOOD is that it is not a specialized
‚Äúdrug‚Äù or ‚Äúsupplement‚Äù that is targeted to solve one specific issue.

It is a whole food capable of giving your body holistic nutrition, thereby
supporting the health of your whole body.

To show you just how well it works, here are a few testimonials from several
customers using BIOSUPERFOOD to support recovery from many different
illnesses:

#### Stress and nervous breakdown :

‚ÄúSix months ago I went through a very difficult period.

Problems and stress built up to the point where I was heading for a nervous
breakdown.

My therapist advised BIOSUPERFOOD by Dr. Kiriac instead of sedatives.

I was astonished at the positive effect of such a natural product!‚Äù ‚Äì Mary B.,
Sweden (Female, 35)

#### Digestive and eye problems :

‚ÄúMy situation consisted of severe digestive problems and a related eye problem
for over five years.

Even after having tried all the supplements that I was recommended, my
situation was still getting worse.

I was not in panic, but I was losing hope of ever recovering my health.

After listening to Professor Kiriac‚Äôs radio talk show with Celine Goudreau, I
concluded that what Professor Kiriac said was possibly my solution.

After using BIOSUPERFOOD now for three months, my digestion and my eye
problems have returned to normal health.

I have been able to eat again and also enjoyed half a bottle of wine with my
friend this weekend.

My energy and endurance that I had lost have also come back. Truly a MIRACLE
of NATURE. Thank you Professor Kiriac.‚Äù ‚Äì G. R. (Male 66) Quebec, Canada

#### Immunity :

‚ÄúToday at my Yoga class, the Pharmanex team was testing people with their
Bioscan antioxidant laser device.

I scored 41,277 for the presence of carotenoid antioxidants in my body‚Ä¶ that
puts me in the top 1% of the world population for Optimal Protection.

What a great feeling of security. I have been taking 1 to 3 capsules of
BIOSUPERFOOD for about 19 months.

P.S. My husband scored 46,294 and he takes 3 to 9 capsules per day.‚Äù ‚Äì Linda
Milon, Denver CO.

BIOSUPERFOOD supports cell health (i.e. it gives the body and brain cells the
energy they require to perform both their general functions (growth,
regeneration, detoxification, etc) and their specialized functions ‚Äì e.g.
sight for eye cells, detoxification for liver cells, etc)

Once cell health can be achieved, it will lead to healthy tissues, which lead
to healthy organs and ultimately a healthy body.

That is how BIOSUPERFOOD helps support your health.

## This ‚Äúsilent disease‚Äù only shows when it‚Äôs too late

#### Let‚Äôs play a little game.

I will give you 3 hints, and you will name the disease I am talking about.

#### Ready?

#1 ‚Äì It primarily affects women (80% of the patients are women)

#2 ‚Äì It is difficult to know you have it except by a scan

#3 ‚Äì You can go from feeling perfectly fine for 20 years (while having this
condition) to landing in a hospital bed all of a sudden.

#### What do you think it is?

Okay, let‚Äôs do one more hint ‚Äì it starts with an ‚ÄúO‚Äù.

#### Do you have the answer yet?

Alright, the disease is  _osteoporosis_.

A fun fact about osteoporosis is that you can have it for decades, continue
life ‚Äúas usual‚Äù and not know.

However if by chance you have a fall, or pick up something slightly heavy with
the wrong technique, you risk fracturing your bone out of the blue.

Which makes it a very terrible condition to have because it doesn‚Äôt show
obvious signs.

Something else is that it affects mostly women due to the drop in estrogen
levels following menopause (as estrogen is vital for healthy bones).

#### All of this begs the question ‚Äì how is it treated?

There are several medical treatments available and you might want to explore
them with your doctor (especially if you are in the advanced stages), but many
of them have been reported to have side effects including ‚Äã‚Äãdizziness, pain
and even some cardiovascular-related diseases.

All I‚Äôm saying is do your research, before using any medication (if you are
going down that route).

If you want to avoid that route, then prevention is the best.

The best way to reduce your risk of osteoporosis is a combination of good
nutrition, exercise, and intake of calcium-rich foods.

#### Enter BIOSUPERFOOD :

BIOSUPERFOOD has the potential to assist the development of proper bone
structures for 3 main reasons:

#1 ‚Äì It provides proper nutrition to the cells of the bones helping them to
grow and regenerate better.

#2 ‚Äì Due to the energy obtained from BIOSUPERFOOD, cells are able to
assimilate calcium (alongside other nutrients) better from the food you eat.

#3 ‚Äì BIOSUPERFOOD nourishes the cells of the brain and ‚Äúawakens‚Äù the
hypothalamus-pituitary region of the brain leading to better regulation of
hormones like estrogen which helps the development of bone structures.

#### Even better :

In a Russian study, when BIOSUPERFOOD was added to the diet of 15,000 dairy
cows, the animals needed less of their daily protein feed and assimilated
enough calcium to no longer suffer osteoporosis.

At the same time, these same animals produced more milk of higher calcium and
overall nutritive value.

Ultimately, BIOSUPERFOOD may help you build stronger bones, and denser bones
and reduce your risk of osteoporosis.
